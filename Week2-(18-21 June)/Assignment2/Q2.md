### Q: Explain the difference between abstract class and interface (Syntax and Purpose)

## Abstract Class
___
Syntax:

- An abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword in languages like Java.
- It can have both abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with a body).
- Abstract classes can have fields (attributes).
- A class can inherit from only one abstract class (single inheritance).
```java
public abstract class Animal {
    // Field
    private String name;

    // Constructor
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Concrete method
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating");
    }

    // Abstract method
    public abstract void makeSound();
}
```
Purpose:

- Abstract classes are used to represent an "is-a" relationship and share code among related classes.
- They are useful when you want to provide a common base with some shared implementation.
- Ideal for base classes where some methods can have default implementation and others need to be implemented by subclasses.
___
## Interface
___
Syntax:

- An interface is declared using the interface keyword.
- Interfaces can only contain abstract methods (until Java 8, where default and static methods were introduced).
- They cannot have fields, only constants (final static fields).
- A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance).

```java
public interface Animal {
    // Constant
    String KINGDOM = "Animalia";

    // Abstract method
    void makeSound();
}
```
### Purpose:

- Interfaces are used to represent a "can-do" relationship and define a contract for what a class can do without specifying how it does it.
- They are ideal for defining capabilities that can be shared across classes from different hierarchies.
- Promotes loose coupling by allowing different classes to implement the same set of methods.

## Key Differences
Syntax:

- Abstract Class: Uses the abstract keyword, can have both abstract and concrete methods, can have fields.

Interface: Uses the interface keyword, contains only abstract methods (until Java 8), and constants.
Purpose:

- Abstract Class: Used to share code among related classes (base class), represents "is-a" relationship.

Interface: Used to define a contract for capabilities, represents "can-do" relationship.
Inheritance:

- Abstract Class: Supports single inheritance (a class can extend only one abstract class).

Interface: Supports multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).
Fields and Methods:

- Abstract Class: Can have fields, constructors, and methods with implementations.

Interface: Cannot have fields (only constants), no constructors, methods are abstract by default (unless default or static methods in Java 8 and later).

## Abstract Class Scenario:

You have an application with different types of animals. An abstract class Animal can define common properties (e.g., name, age) and behaviors (e.g., eat() method) that all animals share. Specific animals like Dog and Cat will extend Animal and provide implementations for abstract methods like makeSound().

## Interface Scenario:

You have various classes that need to implement common functionalities like Serializable, Cloneable, or Comparable. An interface like Serializable ensures that any class that implements it can be serialized, without dictating how serialization is achieved.
