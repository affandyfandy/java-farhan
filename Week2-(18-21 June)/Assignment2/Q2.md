# Abstract Class vs Interface

### ---- Syntax and Purpose ----

## ðŸª¨ **Abstract Class**

---

### Syntax:

- An abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword in languages like Java.
- It can have both abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with a body).
- Abstract classes can have fields (attributes).
- A class can inherit from only one abstract class (single inheritance).

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    // Field
    private String name;

    // Constructor
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Concrete method
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating");
    }

    // Abstract method
    public abstract void makeSound();
}
```

### Purpose:

- Abstract classes are used to represent an "is-a" relationship and share code among related classes.
- They are useful when you want to provide a common base with some shared implementation.
- Ideal for base classes where some methods can have default implementation and others need to be implemented by subclasses.

## ðŸª¨ Interface

---

### Syntax:

- An interface is declared using the interface keyword.
- Interfaces can only contain abstract methods (until Java 8, where default and static methods were introduced).
- They cannot have fields, only constants (final static fields).
- A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance).

```java
public interface Animal {
    // Constant
    String KINGDOM = "Animalia";

    // Abstract method
    void makeSound();
}
```

### Purpose:

- Interfaces are used to represent a "can-do" relationship and define a contract for what a class can do without specifying how it does it.
- They are ideal for defining capabilities that can be shared across classes from different hierarchies.
- Promotes loose coupling by allowing different classes to implement the same set of methods.

## Abstract Class Scenario:

An application with different types of animals. An abstract class Animal can define common properties (e.g., name, age) and behaviors (e.g., eat() method) that all animals share. Specific animals like Dog and Cat will extend Animal and provide implementations for abstract methods like makeSound().

## Interface Scenario:

Various classes that need to implement common functionalities like Serializable, Cloneable, or Comparable. An interface like Serializable ensures that any class that implements it can be serialized, without dictating how serialization is achieved.

| **Abstract Class**                                                                         | **Interface**                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.                              | Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. |
| 2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.                                    | Interface supports multiple inheritance.                                                             |
| 3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static, and non-static variables.             | Interface has only static and final variables.                                                       |
| 4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of an interface.                          | Interface can't provide the implementation of an abstract class.                                     |
| 5) The `abstract` keyword is used to declare an abstract class.                            | The `interface` keyword is used to declare an interface.                                             |
| 6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. | An interface can extend another Java interface only.                                                 |
| 7) An abstract class can be extended using the `extends` keyword.                          | An interface can be implemented using the `implements` keyword.                                      |
| 8) A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.              | Members of a Java interface are public by default.                                                   |
