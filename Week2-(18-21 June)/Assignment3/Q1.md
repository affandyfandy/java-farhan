# ü™® Try with Resources

`try-with-resources statement` is a try statement that declares one or more resources in it. A resource is an object that must be closed once your program is done using it. For example, a File resource or a Socket connection resource.

So, `try-with-resources` is a feature in Java that simplifies to working with resources like files, network connection, or streams that need to be closed after they are used.

Here are some examples of resources that should be closed:
| **Category** | **Classes** |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **File I/O** | - `FileReader`<br>- `FileWriter`<br>- `BufferedReader`<br>- `BufferedWriter`<br>- `InputStream`<br>- `OutputStream`<br>- `FileInputStream`<br>- `FileOutputStream` |
| **Database** | - `Connection`<br>- `Statement`<br>- `PreparedStatement`<br>- `ResultSet` |
| **Network** | - `Socket`<br>- `ServerSocket`<br>- `DatagramSocket` |
| **Memory** | - `RandomAccessFile`<br>- `ByteArrayInputStream`<br>- `ByteArrayOutputStream` |
<!-- 
### Category Explanation

- **File I/O**:

  - **FileReader / FileWriter**: Used for reading and writing characters from and to a file.
  - **BufferedReader / BufferedWriter**: Used for reading and writing text with buffering, improving I/O efficiency.
  - **InputStream / OutputStream**: Base classes for all byte input and output streams in Java.
  - **FileInputStream / FileOutputStream**: Used for reading and writing bytes from and to a file.

- **Database**:

  - **Connection**: Represents a connection to a database.
  - **Statement**: Used for executing simple SQL statements.
  - **PreparedStatement**: Used for executing precompiled SQL statements with parameters.
  - **ResultSet**: Represents the result of executing an SQL query.

- **Network**:

  - **Socket**: Used for creating TCP client-server connections.
  - **ServerSocket**: Used by the server to listen for client connection requests based on TCP.
  - **DatagramSocket**: Used for UDP network communication.

- **Memory**:
  - **RandomAccessFile**: Used for reading and writing to a file with random access, allowing read and write operations at specific positions in the file.
  - **ByteArrayInputStream / ByteArrayOutputStream**: Used for reading and writing data to and from byte arrays in memory. -->

## üìù Syntax

```java
try(declare resources here) {
    // use resources
}
catch(FileNotFoundException e) {
    // exception handling
}
```

## üìù Example

```java
try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("test.txt"))) {
    writer.println("Hello World");
} // test.txt will be any content "Hello World"
```

In try-with-resources can declare multiple resources

```java
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("testRead.txt"));
    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("testWrite.txt"))) {
    while (scanner.hasNext()) {
	writer.print(scanner.nextLine());
    }
} 
// code will read of textRead.txt and write into testWrite.txt
```

So, use try-with-resources for closing resources such as file readers is essential for:

- Avoiding resource leaks.
- Ensuring optimal application performance.
- Avoiding operating system limitations.
- Ensuring data consistency.

Using try-with-resources is the best way to ensure that resources are closed properly, avoiding various problems that may occur due to resources that are not closed.
