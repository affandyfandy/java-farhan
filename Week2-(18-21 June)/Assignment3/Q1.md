### Try with Resources

Try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources in it. A resource is an object that must be closed once your program is done using it. For example, a File resource or a Socket connection resource.

Here are some examples of resources that should be closed:

### File I/O:

- FileReader / FileWriter
- BufferedReader / BufferedWriter
- InputStream / OutputStream (and all its subclasses like FileInputStream, FileOutputStream)

### Database:

- Connection
- Statement
- PreparedStatement
- ResultSet
- Network:

### Socket

- ServerSocket
- DatagramSocket

### Memory:

- RandomAccessFile
- ByteArrayInputStream / ByteArrayOutputStream

```java
try(declare resources here) {
    // use resources
}
catch(FileNotFoundException e) {
    // exception handling
}
```

Simple example:

```java
try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("test.txt"))) {
    writer.println("Hello World");
}
```

In try-with-resources can declare multiple resources

```java
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("testRead.txt"));
    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("testWrite.txt"))) {
    while (scanner.hasNext()) {
	writer.print(scanner.nextLine());
    }
}
```

So use try-with-resources for closing resources such as file readers is essential for:

- Avoiding resource leaks.
- Ensuring optimal application performance.
- Avoiding operating system limitations.
- Ensuring data consistency.

Using try-with-resources is the best way to ensure that resources are closed properly, avoiding various problems that may occur due to resources that are not closed.
