# Q2: Throw vs throws, give example

Simply put, **throw** is a keyword used to throw an exception explicitly in a block of code. in a catch or false conditional, while **throws** is a part of the method declaration used to indicate that the method can throw a specific exception.

| Sr. no. | Basis of Differences    | throw                                                                                                                       | throws                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.      | Definition              | Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly in the code, inside the function or the block of code.          | Java throws keyword is used in the method signature to declare an exception which might be thrown by the function during the execution of the code.                         |
| 2.      | Usage                   | Using throw keyword, we can only propagate unchecked exceptions; checked exceptions cannot be propagated using throw alone. | Using throws keyword, we can declare both checked and unchecked exceptions. However, throws is used to declare exceptions that can be propagated (checked exceptions only). |
| 3.      | Syntax                  | The throw keyword is followed by an instance of Exception to be thrown.                                                     | The throws keyword is followed by class names of Exceptions to be thrown.                                                                                                   |
| 4.      | Declaration             | throw is used within the method.                                                                                            | throws is used in the method signature.                                                                                                                                     |
| 5.      | Internal implementation | We are allowed to throw only one exception at a time i.e., we cannot throw multiple exceptions.                             | We can declare multiple exceptions using throws keyword that can be thrown by the method. For example, `main() throws IOException, SQLException`.                           |

### Throw sample

```java
public class TestThrow {
    //defining a method
    public static void checkNum(int num) {
        if (num < 1) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("\nNumber is negative, cannot calculate square");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Square of " + num + " is " + (num*num));
        }
    }
    //main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
            TestThrow obj = new TestThrow();
            obj.checkNum(-3);
            System.out.println("Rest of the code..");
            //Number is negative, cannot calculate square
    }
}
```

### Throws Sample

```java
public class TestThrowAndThrows
{
    // defining a user-defined method
    // which throws ArithmeticException
    static void method() throws ArithmeticException
    {
        System.out.println("Inside the method()");
        throw new ArithmeticException("throwing ArithmeticException");
    }
    //main method
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        try
        {
            method();
        }
        catch(ArithmeticException e)
        {
            System.out.println("caught in main() method");
        }
    }
}
```
