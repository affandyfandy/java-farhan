# ReadWriteLock interface for concurrent read-write

A ReadWriteLock maintains a pair of associated locks , one for read-only operations and one for writing. The read lock may be held simultaneously by multiple reader threads, so long as there are no writers. The write lock is exclusive.

## ReadWriteLock Locking Rules

The rules by which a thread is allowed to lock the ReadWriteLock either for reading or writing the guarded resource, are as follows:

- Read Lock If no threads have locked the ReadWriteLock for writing,
  and no thread have requested a write lock (but not yet obtained it).
  Thus, multiple threads can lock the lock for reading.
- Write Lock If no threads are reading or writing.
  Thus, only one thread at a time can lock the lock for writing.

### ReadWriteLock Implementations

ReadWriteLock is an interface. Thus, to use a ReadWriteLock

The java.util.concurrent.locks package contains the following ReadWriteLock implementation:

## Basic syntax of ReentrantReadWriteLock

```java
ReadWriteLock readWriteLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();


readWriteLock.readLock().lock();

    // multiple readers can enter this section
    // if not locked for writing, and not writers waiting
    // to lock for writing.

readWriteLock.readLock().unlock();


readWriteLock.writeLock().lock();

    // only one writer can enter this section,
    // and only if no threads are currently reading.

readWriteLock.writeLock().unlock();
//
```

## Sample Code

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ReadWriteLockExample {
    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final List<String> sharedResource = new ArrayList<>();

    // Method to read from the shared resource
    public List<String> readResource() {
        lock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is reading");
            // Simulate reading time
            Thread.sleep(100);
            return new ArrayList<>(sharedResource);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return new ArrayList<>();
        } finally {
            lock.readLock().unlock();
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished reading");
        }
    }

    // Method to write to the shared resource
    public void writeResource(String value) {
        lock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is writing");
            // Simulate writing time
            Thread.sleep(100);
            sharedResource.add(value);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock();
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished writing");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReadWriteLockExample example = new ReadWriteLockExample();

        // Creating threads that read from the resource
        Runnable readTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                example.readResource();
            }
        };

        // Creating threads that write to the resource
        Runnable writeTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                example.writeResource("Data-" + i);
            }
        };

        Thread writer1 = new Thread(writeTask, "Writer-1");
        Thread writer2 = new Thread(writeTask, "Writer-2");
        Thread reader1 = new Thread(readTask, "Reader-1");
        Thread reader2 = new Thread(readTask, "Reader-2");
        Thread reader3 = new Thread(readTask, "Reader-3");

        // Starting the threads
        writer1.start();
        writer2.start();
        reader1.start();
        reader2.start();
        reader3.start();

        // Joining the threads to wait for them to finish
        try {
            writer1.join();
            writer2.join();
            reader1.join();
            reader2.join();
            reader3.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

```

### Explanation:
Shared Resource: We have a List<String> called sharedResource representing our shared data.

Lock Initialization: We create an instance of ReadWriteLock using ReentrantReadWriteLock.

### *Read Method*:
- Acquires the read lock using lock.readLock().lock().
- Simulates reading by sleeping for 100 milliseconds.
- Releases the read lock in the finally block using lock.readLock().unlock().

### *Write Method*:
- Acquires the write lock using lock.writeLock().lock().
- Simulates writing by sleeping for 100 milliseconds and adding data to the list.
- Releases the write lock in the finally block using lock.writeLock().unlock().

### **Sec**
Main Method:
- Creates and starts multiple threads that perform read and write operations on the shared resource.
- Uses join() to ensure the main thread waits for all the reader and writer threads to complete.

This setup allows multiple threads to read the resource concurrently but ensures that write operations are exclusive, preventing data inconsistency issues.
