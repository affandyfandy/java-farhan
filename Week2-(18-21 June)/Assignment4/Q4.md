# What are noticeable things when using multiple thread?

Several noticaable things occurs, when use multiple threads

## Advantage

- Enhanced performance by decreased development time
- Simplified and streamlined program coding
- Improvised GUI responsiveness
- Simultaneous and parallelized occurrence of tasks
- Better use of cache storage by utilization of resources
- Decreased cost of maintenance
- Better use of CPU resource

Improved performance: Multithreading can help increase the overall performance of an application, especially on systems with multiple processors or cores. It allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, utilizing the available CPU resources more efficiently.

Responsiveness: In a single-threaded environment, if a long-running task blocks the main thread, the entire application becomes unresponsive. Multithreading can prevent this issue by running such tasks in separate threads, ensuring the application remains responsive.

Better resource utilization: Multithreading allows better utilization of system resources by keeping the CPU busy while waiting for I/O operations or other tasks to complete.

Simplified modeling: Some problems can be more naturally modeled using multiple threads. This makes the program easier to design, understand, and maintain.

Parallelism: Multithreading enables parallelism, which can lead to significant performance improvements in applications that can be divided into smaller, independent tasks.

## Disadvantage

- Complex debugging and testing processes
- Overhead switching of context
- Increased potential for deadlock occurrence
- Increased difficulty level in writing a program
- Unpredictable results
- Deadlock

Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to the program, making it more difficult to design, implement, and debug. Developers need to be aware of synchronization, deadlocks, race conditions, and other concurrency-related issues.

Synchronization overhead: To avoid data corruption and maintain consistency, developers must synchronize access to shared resources, which can result in additional overhead and reduced performance.

Context switching: Context switching between threads consumes CPU time and resources, which can lead to performance degradation if not managed efficiently.

Hard to predict behavior: Due to the concurrent nature of multithreading, the behavior of the program can be hard to predict and reproduce, especially when it comes to debugging.

Limited by hardware: The performance benefits of multithreading are limited by the number of available cores or processors in the system. In some cases, excessive use of threads can lead to performance degradation instead of improvement.
