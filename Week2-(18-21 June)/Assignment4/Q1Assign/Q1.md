# Deadlock, How to prevent

Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for **each other**.

`So the program will hang forever, for close the program by pressing CTRL+C.`

Deadlock occurs when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in different order. A Java multithreaded program may suffer from the deadlock condition because the synchronized keyword causes the executing thread to block while waiting for the lock, or monitor, associated with the specified object.

Solution for handle deadlock is **re-order** the statements where the code is accessing shared resources, but before re-order have to found what is problem of threads

### ü™® CODE 1

multi-threading

```java
  public static void main(String args[]) {
       ThreadDemo1 T1 = new ThreadDemo1();
       ThreadDemo2 T2 = new ThreadDemo2();
       T1.start();
       T2.start();
       System.out.println("Deadlock Test.........");
    }
```

```java
 private static class ThreadDemo1 extends Thread {
       public void run() {
          synchronized (Lock1) {
             System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1...");

             try { Thread.sleep(10); }
             catch (InterruptedException e) {}
             System.out.println("Thread 1: Waiting for lock 2...");

             synchronized (Lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1 & 2...");
             }
          }
       }
    }
```

```java
private static class ThreadDemo2 extends Thread {
       public void run() {
          synchronized (Lock2) {
             System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 2...");

             try { Thread.sleep(10); }
             catch (InterruptedException e) {}
             System.out.println("Thread 2: Waiting for lock 1...");

             synchronized (Lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 1 & 2...");
             }
          }
       }
    }
```

Code 1 , will be deadlock , because any several potentials

- ThreadDemo1 fetches Lock1 first, then tries to fetch Lock2.
- ThreadDemo2 fetches Lock2 first, then tries to fetch Lock1.

A deadlock condition may occur if the following scenario occurs:

1. ThreadDemo1 fetches Lock1.
2. ThreadDemo2 fetches Lock2.
3. ThreadDemo1 tries to fetch Lock2, but Lock2 is being held by ThreadDemo2.
4. ThreadDemo2 tries to fetch Lock1, but Lock1 is being held by ThreadDemo1.

In this situation, both threads will wait forever for each other to release the resources they need, causing a deadlock.

### üñãÔ∏è CODE 2 - Solution

re-order for holding lock 1 and lock 2 , in thread 2

```java
private static class ThreadDemo2 extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (Lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 1...");

                try {
                    Thread.sleep(10);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                }
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Waiting for lock 2...");

                synchronized (Lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 1 & 2...");
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

this code will run , and deadlock not happen because thread 1 and thread 2 fetch locks in the same order.

- ThreadDemo1 fetches Lock1 first, then Lock2.
- ThreadDemo2 also fetches Lock1 first, then Lock2.

## **Principles for prevent deadlock**

---

- Lock Fetch Sequencing: Ensure that the lock fetching order of the two threads is entirely different. That is, if ThreadDemo1 fetches Lock1 and Lock2 in a particular order, make sure ThreadDemo2 fetches the locks in the opposite order.
- Nested Lock Avoidance: Avoid nested locks (fetching more than one lock in a thread in sequence). This can reduce complexity and the risk of deadlock.
- Use of Timeouts: You can consider using a timeout mechanism in lock fetching to avoid deadlock situations that get stuck for too long.
