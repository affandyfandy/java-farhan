# Make comparison of ArrayList vs LinkedList and HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet

## ArrayList vs LinkedList

### ArrayList

- Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
- It is like an array, but there is no size limit. We can add or remove elements anytime.
  no need for declare the size because dynamic
- So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array. It is found in the java.util package.
  <!-- Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements. -->
  <!-- Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order. -->
  <!-- Java ArrayList class is non synchronized. -->
- Java ArrayList allows random access because the array works on an index basis.
- In ArrayList, manipulation is a little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.
- We can not create an array list of the primitive types, such as int, float, char, etc. It is required to use the required wrapper class in such cases. For example:

### LinkedList

- Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
- It provides a linked-list data structure. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
- Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
- In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
- Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.


| ArrayList                                                                                                                                                           | LinkedList                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.                                                                                                 | LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.                                                                |
| 2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the other elements are shifted in memory. | Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory. |
| 3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.                                                                                       | LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.                                    |
| 4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.                                                                                                              | LinkedList is better for manipulating data.                                                                                           |
| 5) The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous.                                                                                              | The location for the elements of a linked list is not contiguous.                                                                     |
| 6) Generally, when an ArrayList is initialized, a default capacity of 10 is assigned to the ArrayList.                                                              | There is no case of default capacity in a LinkedList. In LinkedList, an empty list is created when a LinkedList is initialized.       |
| 7) To be precise, an ArrayList is a resizable array.                                                                                                                | LinkedList implements the doubly linked list of the list interface.                                                                   |

## HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet

### HashSet
Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet class and implements Set interface.

### TreeSet
Java TreeSet class implements the Set interface that uses a tree for storage. It inherits AbstractSet class and implements the NavigableSet interface. The objects of the TreeSet class are stored in ascending order.

### LinkedHashSet
Java LinkedHashSet class is a Hashtable and Linked list implementation of the Set interface. It inherits the HashSet class and implements the Set interface.
