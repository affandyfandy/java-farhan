# Make comparison of ArrayList vs LinkedList and HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet

## ðŸ—¿ **ArrayList vs LinkedList**

### ArrayList

- Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
- It is like an array, but there is no size limit. We can add or remove elements anytime.
  no need for declare the size because dynamic
- So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array. It is found in the java.util package.
- Java ArrayList allows random access because the array works on an index basis.
- In ArrayList, manipulation is a little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.
- We can not create an array list of the primitive types, such as int, float, char, etc. It is required to use the required wrapper class in such cases. For example:

### LinkedList

- Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
- It provides a linked-list data structure. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
- Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
- In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
- Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.                                                                                                 | LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.                                                                |
| 2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the other elements are shifted in memory. | Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory. |
| 3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.                                                                                       | LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.                                    |
| 4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.                                                                                                              | LinkedList is better for manipulating data.                                                                                           |
| 5) The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous.                                                                                              | The location for the elements of a linked list is not contiguous.                                                                     |
| 6) Generally, when an ArrayList is initialized, a default capacity of 10 is assigned to the ArrayList.                                                              | There is no case of default capacity in a LinkedList. In LinkedList, an empty list is created when a LinkedList is initialized.       |
| 7) To be precise, an ArrayList is a resizable array.                                                                                                                | LinkedList implements the doubly linked list of the list interface.                                                                   |

| Category                 | ArrayList                                       | LinkedList                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **When Should We Use?** | Fast access by index, infrequent insert/delete  | Frequent insertions/deletions, queue-like operations |
| **Order**               | Maintains insertion order                       | Maintains insertion order                            |
| **Null element**        | Allows null                                     | Allows null                                          |
| **Performance**         | Fast access (O(1)), slower insert/delete (O(n)) | Fast insert/delete (O(1)), slower access (O(n))      |
| **Synchronized**        | Not synchronized                                | Not synchronized                                     |
| **Fail-Fast/Fail-Safe** | Fail-Fast iterators                             | Fail-Fast iterators                                  |
| **When to Use?**        | Index-based access, small-medium lists          | Frequent insertions/deletions, smaller lists         |

## ðŸ—¿ **HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet**

### HashSet

Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet class and implements Set interface.

### TreeSet

Java TreeSet class implements the Set interface that uses a tree for storage. It inherits AbstractSet class and implements the NavigableSet interface. The objects of the TreeSet class are stored in ascending order.

### LinkedHashSet

Java LinkedHashSet class is a Hashtable and Linked list implementation of the Set interface. It inherits the HashSet class and implements the Set interface.

ArrayList vs LinkedList: Use ArrayList for fast index-based access and LinkedList for frequent insertions/deletions.

HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet: Use HashSet for general-purpose set operations, TreeSet for sorted elements, and LinkedHashSet for maintaining insertion order while ensuring uniqueness.
